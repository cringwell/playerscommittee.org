## [STAR WARS CUSTOMIZABLE CARD GAME *(SWCCG)*](https://www.starwarsccg.org/about-us/)

Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card Game is one of the industry's most successful card games ever made! The game allows players to totally immerse themselves in the Star Wars universe and literally take on just about any role in the Galactic Civil War. Players customize a 60-card deck for either the Rebellion or the Empire. Deck themes range anywhere from building Rebel bases to commanding your own legion of stormtroopers or Starfleet to epic lightsaber duels between Jedi and Sith to playing in the more dangerous world of smugglers and bounty hunters. You can even try recreate your favorite parts of the Classic trilogy by blowing up the Death Star or the bunker on Endor, training Luke in the ways of the Force, rescuing Leia from the Death Star, or the Battles of Hoth or Endor. The game does have some complexities and thus requires relative patience to learn. However, the patience pays off when a player realizes that, past the rules and with over 2000 cards at their disposal, a player can make and do just about anything they want within the "galaxy far, far away".
